# module-gdpr_notice
A Drupal 7 module to display a cookie notice for GDPR compliance. 
Future functionality might include admin options to update text and set colors and font.

# Non-Drupal Sites
To add the notice to a site manually, put the js file (cookie.notice.js) somewhere accessible and then include the following in the ```<head>``` section of your pages:
  
```
<script type="text/javscript" src="path/to/the/file/cookie.notice.js"></script>
```
